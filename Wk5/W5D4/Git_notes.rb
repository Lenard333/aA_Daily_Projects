 # Why we use git::
#Version control : keep track of changes
#multiple people can work on a project at once


#2 main models in gift
#1 = working directory
   # working directory will keep track of all the updates on the files and folders
   #
#2 = Staging Area
   # changes to be committed = added through #git add command
   # indicates that the file has been completed


## git commands

#git status
    # this returns most recent status of modification

#git add "folder address"
   # saves changes made to git  folder

#git commit -m
  # git commit saves the file in staging area as a snapshot
  # - m adds a message or a title

#git branch
  # shows current branch of files


#git co -b add_cherryl
  # co stands for "check out"
  # -b stands for branch
  # "add_cherryl" is the name portion of the gift
  # doens't become a "branch"/file until it is committed
  # it's similar to cd " changing directory "
  # checking out a branch is similar to creating a directory within the selected directory



#git diff
  # shows the line changed

#git merge "name"


## how to start using git
