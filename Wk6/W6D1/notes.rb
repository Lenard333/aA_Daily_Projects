# ADT

# set
  #set
  #delete
     # no duplicates
#map/dictionary structure
  #set   k = v
  #get  get k
  #delete   delete k
    # no duplicates only one key

# why ADT is important
  # different algorithms are better implemented to different data structures

# STACK
  #LASTINFIRST OUT
  # push & pop
    # push puts data into array from the back
    # pop taking out data out of array
    #often done with recursion

# QUEUE
  #FIRST IN FIRST OUT
  # push and shift
  # push entry from the back
  #shift take out entry from the front
  # or unshift and pop



#TREE
  #    0        #binary tree
  #  0   0
  #0   0 0 0

   #           0              Ternary tree
   #     0     0      0
   #  0   0 0 00 0  0 0 0

   # tree with undefinite amout of childre = n-ary tree or poly tree

 #root of tree is the first element of a tree
 #nodes are each level of tree

 #leafnode = last node of a tree
 # DFS
   #straight down the tree

# BFS
   # one layer at a time
